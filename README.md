# ProofTrees

For Development:
Ignore everything except proof_trees.js and index.html

For Demo:
A proof tree is composed of a set of nodes where each node has an inference label, conclusion, and then an arbitrary number of children(premises). To add a node fill out conclusion and label boxes then click "Add Node". Once tree is constructed graphically link appropriate parent child relationships by selecting a pair of nodes(red will be parent, blue child) and then clicking "Link". Once all linking is done click "Get Tex" to get proof tree tex generated representing GUI.

Double click to delete a node(but only if not yet linked).

Drag a node to move it.

NOTE: Generated tex only compatible with proof latex package.
