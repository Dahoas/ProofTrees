Need:
	Click button to make nodes
	Translate by dragging with mouse
	Link parent and children dynamically
	double click deletes

Currently what I'm doing can be easily replicated in Word: But the point is to generate latex that constructs the proof treess

Automatically Generating Latex: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/26972/what-gui-applications-are-there-to-assist-in-generating-graphics-for-tex

To represent proof tree can just construct tree datastructure. Then to go from GUI to proof tree we go from GUI to tree to proof tree(latex)

Tree structure:
	Nodes:
		Label: 1
		Conclusion: 1
	Arbitrary number of children

Development Annoyances:
	1. Had to fix CORS error with: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/3885

Potential Issues:
	1. Linking system may not give right order as suggested by GUI(is instead determined by order of link button click/child list)
	2. Need to approptiately resize lines to fit all children premises

Solved Hard Problems:
